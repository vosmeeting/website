              <p>
                This is a TABLE-TOP show only. One 2’ x 6’ draped display table
                per booth (table sizes may vary slightly) will be supplied.
                Encroachment is not allowed. Exhibits and displays must be
                confined to the rented space (8’W x 6’D, includes side
                clearance). The maximum height of a table top display is 8’ at
                the back of the booth and 4’ in the front half of the booth
                space. Exhibits may not exceed these parameters.
                <span className="underline">
                  The room we will be using has a ceiling height of 8.5ft
                </span>
                . The aisles are common property of all exhibitors and must not
                be obstructed at any time. Fire code regulations prohibit
                exhibits from extending into aisles. A freestanding backdrop may
                be used (not to extend more than 8’ in total width), or a banner
                may be attached to the front of the table. Booth signage is not
                provided. The hotel will not allow signage to hang on the walls.
                Booths do not include decorations or utilities such as internet,
                signage, electrical outlets, special lighting or water.
                Furnishings and accessories beyond what is listed are not
                included. Pipe and drape may not be provided, depending on
                facility configuration. If you have any questions please contact
                the hotel (Hyatt Regency O’hare)
              </p>
              <Subheading>Installation and Dismantling of Exhibits</Subheading>
              <p>
                Exhibitor sign up and setup will be from 3-6pm Friday. The
                welcome reception will take place at the exhibitor hall (from 6-
                9pm). We recommend exhibit hall booths be operational by 6pm.
                Exhibitor hours are elective during the reception Friday night,
                although it’s highly advised being present. Exhibitor hours
                during the meeting is: 8-6pm Saturday, 8-12pm Sunday. Tear down
                of exhibitors will take place after the last morning lecture on
                Sunday. Exhibits must be off the floor by 6pm Sunday. We have
                secured the meeting space until Sunday, therefore early tear
                down or removal of merchandise overnight or after the first day
                of installation and before dismantling time is discouraged.
              </p>

                Reception appetizers, breakfast and lunch:
              </Subheading>
              <p>
                Both are included in the registration fee, however exhibitors
                may choose to eat at the hotel establishments as well. Lunch
                cannot be delivered separately to the booths in this hotel per
                union service rules. A ticketing system may be used. Exhibitors
                will be given a free drink ticket per person during the
                reception, which will host a cash bar and hopefully a live Jazz
                band again.

                The booth Service agreement form was provided along with this

                coming in for groups, also the ordering form for individual
                companies to purchase power and A/V services for the booths.{' '}

                  Please send/fax the booth service agreement form to the hotel
                  and not to us. Do not hesitate to contact the hotel if you

              <Subheading>Room Rates & Reservations:</Subheading>
              <p>
                Once we have the hotel room link for booking with our discounted
                rates, we will send it for all registered exhibitors. This will
                be available until registration opens to attendees, then these
                spaces may quickly sell out. It is recommended exhibitors book a
                room and cancel later to be safe.

                  the type of sponsorship (see first page). The sponsors will
                  have priority in selecting booths in the next event, in the
                  order of sponsorship value.
